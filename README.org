#+TITLE: dragon bindings for dired

Have you every needed to drag and drop something but then realised that you have
to open a /shudders/ non emacs file manger? Well no more! This package adds
bindings for [[https://github.com/mwh/dragon][dragon]] so that you can live in emacs a little more!

** How does it work?
*** Source commands
you mark the file like normal (using =m=) and call one of these commands
(flags are what I use for dragon)
| Command                     | Use                                           | flags   |
|-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+---------|
| ~dired-dragon~              | dumps all the files and exits once done       | =-x -a= |
| ~dired-dragon-stay~         | sticks around but dumps all the files         | =-a=    |
| ~dired-dragon-individual~   | you can individually drag and drop the files  |         |

*** TODO Sink commands
| commands                    | use                                           | flags   |
|-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+---------|
| ~dired-dragon-take-in~      | TODO drop files into the current dired buffer | =-t -x= |
| ~dired-dragon-take-in-stay~ | TODO same as above but it will stick around   | =-t=    |
